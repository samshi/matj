# matj
- MatJ is a online scientific computing platform, which aims to provide open source scientific computing and numerical analysis tools compatible with MATLAB syntax
- MaJ is a JS math library for running Matlab scripts.
- Matj is a cross platform web DAPP that supports windows, Linux, MacOS, Android and tablets

# function:
- base: ones, zeros, eye, linear, linspace, all trigonometric
- matrix: blkdiag, bounds, cat, diag, flip, repmat, reshape, rot90
- linear algebra: chol, cond, det, eig, hess,hilb, inv, lu, magic, norm, orth, pascal, pinv, qr, rref, svd, tril, triu
- polynomial: factor, fzero, polyval, roots
- differential/integral: diff, polyint, polyder, solve, sym, limit



# test
-In matj/src/matj_assets/assets/test/, you will find 200+ function tests and plot scripts.

## Running the project locally

If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --background

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
dfx deploy
```

Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:8000?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.

Additionally, if you are making frontend changes, you can start a development server with

```bash
npm start
```

Which will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 8000.

### Note on frontend environment variables

If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:

- set`NODE_ENV` to `production` if you are using Webpack
- use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.NODE_ENV` in the autogenerated declarations
- Write your own `createActor` constructor
